        <h1>Femicide and Gender-Based Violence Dashboard</h1>
        <p>
            Femicide refers to the killing of women and girls, often on account of their gender. In many countries, it is not recognised as a crime independent of homicide.
            The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, are a set of 17 aims agreed upon by the United Nations, implemented in 2015 and hopefully to be achieved by 2030. SDG number 5 concerns gender equality, and has a specific list of indicators.
            The purpose of this research is to determine whether the SDG indicators are a sufficient measure of gender equality, by comparing rates and recognition of femicide to countries’ performances on SDG 5. There are three countries of varying performance being examined: Ireland, South Africa, and the United States of America.
        </p>
           <p>
        Use the interactive graphs below to uncover the relationship between rates and recognition of femicide and performance on SDG 5.
    </p>

<section class="section" id="legal-recognition">
    <h2>Legal Recognition and Statistical Visibility</h2>
    <p>
        Across the three focus countries, femicide is only partially recognised in law and statistics. 
        In Ireland, there is no legal definition of femicide and no dedicated national statistics, which limits systematic 
        monitoring of such killings (McGoldrick, Collis, and Mulligan 2024). In the United States, the absence of a distinct 
        penal category for gender-related killings likewise hampers efforts to track femicide (Lewis et al. 2024). 
        By contrast, several Southern African states have adopted laws and strategies on gender-based violence and femicide, 
        including South Africa’s National Strategic Plan on Gender-Based Violence and Femicide, Botswana’s Gender-Based 
        Violence Act of 2008, and Lesotho’s Counter Domestic Violence Act of 2022, yet these measures are widely regarded as 
        failing to curb lethal violence against women in practice (Ngube n.d.).

                This visualisation shows the total number of female homicide victims per year in Ireland, South Africa, and the United States. The stark difference in counts can be put down to the large difference in populations, but what is important to note is the sharp rise in counts in both South Africa and the USA since the implementation of SDG 5. Ireland has maintained a steady count across the years since the implementation of SDG 5.

            <ul>
                <li>South Africa reports the highest absolute femicide counts throughout the observed period, with annual totals often exceeding 2,500 victims.</li>
                <li>The United States displays persistently high counts as well, ranging between roughly 3,300 and 5,000 victims per year.</li>
                <li>Ireland’s absolute numbers are very low in comparison, typically varying between 2 and 15 victims annually.</li>
                <li>All three countries show fluctuations, with notable increases in recent years for South Africa and the United States.</li>

        <p><strong>What the figure shows:</strong><br>
            By showing rates rather than counts, this visualisation allows a clearer comparison of femicide across countries. 
            While South Africa and the United States appear closer in the counts graph, the rate graph separates them sharply and 
            highlights South Africa’s steep increase in recent years.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Major findings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>South Africa has by far the highest femicide rates, with several years above 9 per 100,000 women.</li>
            <li>The United States shows medium-level rates, generally between 2 and 3 per 100,000.</li>
            <li>Ireland’s rate remains very low, staying below 1 per 100,000 across the period.</li>
            <li>Rates in South Africa rise sharply around 2021–2022, suggesting a worsening situation.</li>
            <li>Rates in Ireland and the United States are more stable, with only modest recent increases.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The New York Times shows sustained and comparatively high coverage of all three terms.
                    Mentions of “gender-based violence” rise from around one hundred per year in the mid-2010s
                    to roughly three hundred around 2020, while “femicide” and “homicide against women” also
                    see clear increases over the period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the Irish Times, references are sparse and intermittent. “Femicide” appears only in a few
                    years with very low counts, “gender-based violence” is mentioned only occasionally, and
                    “homicide against women” is absent in the period covered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall, the US newspaper devotes much more frequent attention to these terms than the Irish
                    newspaper, though part of this contrast may reflect its larger size, international scope, and
                    the difference in population between the two countries.

                <li>South Africa experiences a sharp increase around 2021–2022, indicating a worsening situation.</li>
                <li>Ireland and the United States are relatively stable overall, with only slight recent increases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Long-Term Female Homicide Counts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The United States records the highest absolute femicide counts, roughly 3,300–5,000 victims per year.</li>
                <li>South Africa also shows very high numbers relative to its population, often above 2,500 victims per year.</li>
                <li>Ireland’s absolute figures are very low in comparison, usually between 2 and 15 victims annually.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Media Mentions</h3>
            <p>Media attention differs sharply across the three countries; population size should be kept in mind.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The United States produces the highest number of mentions, especially for “gender-based violence”, with over 700 per year in the most recent period.</li>
                <li>South Africa also shows substantial coverage, particularly on “gender-based violence”.</li>
                <li>Ireland has relatively low media attention for both terms, but mentions rise clearly after 2020.</li>
                <li>In all three countries, references to “gender-based violence” consistently outnumber those to “femicide”.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>SDG 5 Progress Over Time</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ireland and the United States show steady, gradual improvements in their SDG 5 scores, reflecting ongoing institutional and policy progress.</li>
                <li>South Africa starts from a relatively high score but shows more pronounced fluctuations, including a slight dip between 2018 and 2020.</li>
                <li>By 2022, all three countries converge at broadly similar SDG 5 levels.</li>

        <h2>Gender-Based Violence and Femicide in South Africa</h2>

        <p>
            Gender-Based Violence and Femicide (GBVF) in South Africa remain among the most severe
            globally. This context is essential when interpreting the country’s comparatively strong
            SDG 5 score, which reflects formal commitments rather than lived realities.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Figures on GBVF in South Africa</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The femicide rate is six times higher than the global average, with at least 15 women murdered every day.</li>
            <li>In 2023/24, <strong>5,578 women</strong> were murdered — a <strong>33.8% increase</strong> from the previous year.</li>
            <li>In the same period, <strong>1,656 children</strong> were murdered — a <strong>38.7% increase</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>42,569 rape cases</strong> were reported to the police in 2023/24, while an estimated <strong>95% of rape cases go unreported</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>63,054 assaults</strong> with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm against women were recorded in 2023/24.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These figures illustrate the depth of the crisis and why statistical output alone cannot
            fully capture the gender-equality situation in South Africa.
        </p>

        <h3>Civil-Society Response: Women for Change</h3>
        <p>
            Women for Change (WFC), founded in 2016, is one of South Africa’s most influential
            non-profit organisations focused on combating GBVF. WFC leads national campaigns, public
            demonstrations, and community mobilisation efforts to raise awareness and advocate for
            stronger institutional responses.
        </p>

        <h3>How Gender-Equality Indices Interpret South Africa</h3>

        <p><strong>SDG 5 (Gender Equality):</strong> A UN goal centred on legal frameworks, political representation,
            and broad development targets. South Africa is currently assessed as having achieved SDG 5,
            while the US and Ireland still face significant challenges.</p>

        <p><strong>Why SDG 5 can mislead:</strong> SDG 5 does not measure gender inequality adequately.
            Its limited and uneven indicators reward legal commitments rather than lived conditions.
            This helps explain why South Africa appears “on track” despite extremely high levels of GBVF
            and persistent socio-economic inequalities.</p>

        <p><strong>GII (Gender Inequality Index):</strong> A composite metric measuring inequality in reproductive
            health, empowerment, and labour markets.</p>

        <p><strong>EU Gender Equality Index:</strong> Tracks six domains—work, money, knowledge, time, power,
            and health—and includes two cross-cutting areas: violence and intersecting inequalities.</p>

        <p>
            Together, these frameworks show that while South Africa performs strongly on some
            institutional indicators, alternative indices reveal significant disparities that align
            more closely with the lived experience reflected in GBVF data.

        <h2>About the Data and Methods</h2>
        <p>
            This dashboard combines several sources:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Female homicide counts and rates from national statistical offices and UNODC.</li>
            <li>SDG 5 scores from the SDG Index.</li>
            <li>Media references to femicide and gender-based violence from targeted media searches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The visualisations are intended to provide a structured empirical overview of femicide,
            gender-based violence, and institutional gender equality across three countries, to
            support qualitative and policy discussion rather than produce definitive causal estimates.
        </p>
    </section>
<section class="section" id="overall-findings">
    <h2>Overall Findings</h2>

    <p>
        Among the countries examined, South Africa is the only one that legally recognises femicide. 
        It also performs highest on SDG 5, yet simultaneously has the highest femicide rate. Femicide 
        rates have increased in all three countries since 2015, with South Africa showing the most 
        substantial rise and the United States and Ireland experiencing more modest growth. Absolute 
        counts have risen sharply in the United States, although this is heavily influenced by its 
        population size.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of recognition and public discussion, South Africa legally defines femicide but does 
        not exhibit strong visibility in public discourse. Google Trends data shows rising interest 
        in all countries, yet South Africa’s search activity for “femicide” and “gender-based violence” 
        is similar to Ireland’s despite its much larger population. Newspaper headline data for South 
        Africa could not be obtained. The United States shows far greater media engagement on both terms 
        than Ireland, with increasing mentions since 2015, while Ireland has seen little change.
    </p>

    <p>
        SDG 5 scores have increased in all countries since 2015, with South Africa currently ranked 
        highest according to the SDG Index. However, the core question of whether SDG 5 performance 
        correlates with other gender-equality indicators—such as femicide—receives little support from 
        the data. The country facing the most severe femicide problem is also the country where the issue 
        appears least publicly discussed, and where SDG 5 performance is officially strongest. The United 
        States and Ireland also show rising femicide rates alongside rising SDG 5 scores.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, SDG 5 appears built on an insufficient set of indicators. It does not adequately capture 
        several key dimensions of gender inequality, including some of the most critical forms of harm.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Data and Methods</h2>

    <p>
        This dashboard draws on multiple data sources. Female homicide counts and rates come from national 
        statistical agencies and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). SDG 5 scores are 
        taken from the SDG Index. Media references to femicide and gender-based violence are obtained from 
        targeted media searches, and search-interest patterns are derived from Google Trends.
    </p>

    <p>
        The visualisations provide a structured empirical overview of femicide, gender-based violence, and 
        institutional gender equality across Ireland, South Africa, and the United States. Their purpose is 
        to support qualitative interpretation and policy debate, not to make causal claims. In this sense, 
        the dashboard functions similarly to academic and public-policy data platforms: it informs discussion, 
        facilitates comparison across time and context, and highlights emerging patterns without asserting 
        definitive causal explanations.
